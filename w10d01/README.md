### To Do
- [x] "Rails Week" Conversation
- [x] MVC Review
- [x] Rails Libraries
- [x] Quickly build simple Rails app
- [x] Nested Resources

### Rails Week Conversation
* enjoy following a teaching rather than reading (@KV EDD videos)
* motivation is a little lacking due to burnout
* second that! videos were great!
* Vas' breakout really clarified concepts
* spent longer debugging WSL2
* self-directed learning was more challenging but felt like deeper learning
* help on Google, but finding relevant help

### MVC
* Model View Controller
* Model - responsible for interacting with the data
* View - templating engine/creates webpage for the client
* Controller - communicates between model and view

### Rails Libraries
* collection of libraries

* Active Record - data interaction layer (User.all)
* Action View - templating engine (erb), provides helper functions (link_to, form_for)
* Action Controller - brains of the operation
* Action Dispatch - receives and routes the incoming request
* Action Cable - web sockets
